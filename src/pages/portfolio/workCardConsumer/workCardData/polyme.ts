	detail: `PolyMe is my personal website to show my personal information and development experience. The name of the application symbolizes the multi-oriented me, and the logo uses a crow with multi-colored blocks, where the crow represents a low profile soaring in the big sky, and the multi-colored blocks represent different orientations of me, which combines to mean a multi-oriented me who quietly works hard in the field of information.

	Technically, I used some newer front-end toolchains to speed up compilation and execution time. In addition, to support some proxy services and http3, I chose not to use the Saas platform to set up, but to use Caddy 2 to set up on my own VPS. I also did some SEO optimization.`,
